# 🧠 Classical Machine Learning with Scikit-learn  
### 🌸 Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris Dataset

This notebook is part of the **AI Tools and Applications Assignment**, showcasing practical classical machine learning with Scikit-learn using the **Iris flower dataset**.  
We build, evaluate, and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier to classify flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand classical ML using Scikit-learn
- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier
- Visualize data distribution and model structure
- Interpret accuracy, precision, and recall results
